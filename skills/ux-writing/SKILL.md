# UX Writing

Write clear, concise, user-centered interface copy (UX text/microcopy) for digital products and experiences. This skill provides frameworks, patterns, and best practices for creating text that helps users accomplish their goals.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Writing interface copy (buttons, labels, titles, messages, forms)
- Editing existing UX text for clarity and effectiveness
- Creating error messages, notifications, or success messages
- Designing conversational flows or onboarding experiences
- Establishing voice and tone for a product
- Auditing product content for consistency and usability

## Core UX Writing Principles

### The Four Quality Standards

Every piece of UX text should be:

1. **Purposeful** — Helps users or the business achieve goals
2. **Concise** — Uses the fewest words possible without losing meaning
3. **Conversational** — Sounds natural and human, not robotic
4. **Clear** — Unambiguous, accurate, and easy to understand

### Key Best Practices

**Conciseness**
- Use 40-60 characters per line maximum
- Every word must have a job
- Break dense text into scannable chunks
- Front-load important information
- Eliminate deadwood phrases ("in order to" → "to", "due to the fact that" → "because", "at this point in time" → "now")
- Replace phrasal verbs with direct verbs ("find out" → "discover", "set up" → "configure", "carry out" → "perform")
- Avoid stacking modifiers — one adjective is usually enough

**Clarity**
- Use plain language (7th grade reading level for general, 10th for professional)
- Avoid jargon, idioms, and technical terms
- Use consistent terminology throughout
- Choose meaningful, specific verbs
- Avoid discriminatory or exclusionary language (gendered defaults, ableist idioms, culturally specific metaphors)

**Conversational Tone**
- Write how you speak
- Use active voice 85% of the time
- Include prepositions and articles
- Avoid robotic phrasing

**User-Centered**
- Focus on user benefits, not features
- Anticipate and answer user questions
- Use second-person ("you") language
- Match user's language and mental models

## UX Text Patterns

Apply these common patterns for interface elements.

### Titles
- **Purpose**: Orient users to where they are
- **Format**: Noun phrases. **Page titles, modal/dialog titles, and menu/navigation items use title case** (see Capitalization below for title-case mechanics). **Lower-level headings (H3+), figure captions, callouts, and table titles use sentence case.**
- **Types**: Brand titles, content titles, category titles, task titles
- **Examples**:
  - Page title (title case): "Account Settings", "Your Library", "Run Payroll"
  - Lower-level heading (sentence case): "Recent activity", "Bank account details", "Tax withholdings"

### Buttons and Links
- **Purpose**: Enable users to take action
- **Format**: Active imperative verbs, sentence case
- **Pattern**: `[Verb] [object]` 
- **Examples**: "Save changes", "Delete account", "View details"
- **Avoid**: Generic labels like "OK", "Submit", "Click here"

### Error Messages
- **Purpose**: Explain problem and provide solution
- **Format**: Empathetic, clear, actionable
- **Pattern**: `[What failed]. [Why/context]. [What to do].`

**Error Message Types**

**Validation Errors (Inline)**
- Show as user completes field or on blur
- Brief, specific guidance to correct input
- Pattern: `[Field] [specific requirement]`
- Examples:
  - "Email must include @"
  - "Password must be at least 8 characters"
  - "Choose a date in the future"
- Timing: Real-time or on field exit
- Location: Below or beside the field

**System Errors (Modal/Banner)**
- Show when backend operations fail
- Explain what happened and why
- Pattern: `[Action failed]. [Likely cause]. [Recovery step].`
- Examples:
  - "Payment failed. Your card was declined. Try a different payment method."
  - "Couldn't save changes. Connection lost. Reconnect and try again."
  - "Upload failed. File is too large. Choose a file under 10MB."
- Timing: Immediately after failure
- Location: Modal dialog or prominent banner

**Blocking Errors (Full-screen)**
- Prevent continued use until resolved
- Clear explanation of blocker and resolution
- Pattern: `[What's blocked]. [Why]. [Specific action needed].`
- Examples:
  - "Update required. This version is no longer supported. Update now to continue."
  - "Subscription expired. Your account is paused. Renew subscription to restore access."
  - "Verification needed. Confirm your email to access features. Check your inbox."
- Timing: On app launch or feature access
- Location: Full screen or large modal

**Permission Errors**
- Explain benefit before requesting permission
- Pattern: `[User benefit]. [Permission needed].`
- Examples:
  - "Get notified when orders ship. Enable notifications."
  - "Find nearby stores. Allow location access."
  - "Back up your photos. Grant storage permission."
- Timing: When feature is first used
- Location: In context of the feature

**What to Avoid**
- Technical codes without explanation ("Error 403")
- Blame language ("invalid input", "illegal character")
- Robotic tone ("An error has occurred")
- Dead ends (error with no recovery path)
- Vague causes ("Something went wrong")

### Success Messages
- **Purpose**: Confirm action completion
- **Format**: Past tense, specific, encouraging
- **Pattern**: `[Action] [result/benefit]`
- **Examples**: "Changes saved", "Email sent", "Profile updated"

### Empty States
- **Purpose**: Guide users when content is absent
- **Types**: First-use, user-cleared, error/no results
- **Format**: Explanation + CTA to populate
- **Example**: "No messages yet. Start a conversation to connect with your team."

### Form Fields
- **Labels**: Clear noun phrases describing input ("Email address", "Phone number")
- **Instructions**: Verb-first, explain why information is needed
- **Placeholder**: Use sparingly, only for standard inputs like "name@example.com"
- **Helper text**: Static, on-demand, or automatic based on importance

### Notifications
- **Purpose**: Deliver timely, valuable information
- **Types**: Action-required (intrusive), Passive (less intrusive)
- **Format**: Verb-first title + contextual description
- **Example**: "Update required. Install the latest version to continue."

## Formatting & Style Conventions

### Capitalization

- **Sentence case** (default): Body text, descriptions, helper text, error messages, success messages, tooltips, placeholder text, **button labels**, lower-level (H3+) headings, figure captions, callouts, table titles
- **Title case**: Page titles, modal/dialog titles, menu and navigation items, form field labels
- **All-caps**: Reserved for **short overline / eyebrow labels** (≤3 words) that sit above a heading or metric — e.g., stat-card section headers like `EMPLOYEES`, `TOTAL PAY`, `LAST UPDATED`, category tags over KPI values — and for **acronyms** (`PDF`, `URL`, `API`, `EIN`, `SSN`). Trimble's own product surfaces use this treatment for short category overlines; it's an intentional typographic signal, not shouting. **Do not** use all-caps for prose, button labels, error messages, page titles, tabs/menu labels, or any string longer than ~3 words — beyond that length readability drops sharply and it reads as shouting.

**Title case mechanics** (applies wherever title case is used):

- Capitalize the first and last word of the title regardless of part of speech.
- Capitalize all adjectives, adverbs, and nouns.
- Capitalize all pronouns (including "it").
- Capitalize all verbs, including the verb "to be" in all forms (is, are, was, has been, etc.).
- Capitalize "no", "not", and the interjection "O".
- Do **not** capitalize articles ("a", "an", "the") unless first or last in the title.
- Do **not** capitalize coordinating conjunctions ("and", "or", "nor", "but", "for", "yet", "so") unless first or last in the title.
- Do **not** capitalize "to" (with or without an infinitive) unless first or last in the title.
- Do **not** capitalize prepositions (e.g., "in", "on", "at", "by", "of", "with") unless first or last in the title.

Examples:
- "Run Payroll for the Pay Period"
- "Add a New Employee"
- "How to File Quarterly Taxes"

**Lista interpretations of edge cases:**

- **"Coming soon"** is the canonical future-feature label everywhere it appears (badges, callouts, copy). Even when used in a title-cased context, write it sentence case per the `lista-ui-conventions` rule. Do not expose milestone granularity ("Coming at Beta", "Coming at GA") in user-facing strings.
- **Dropdown action items** (imperative-verb items inside a button-triggered menu, e.g. `"Add employee"`, `"See payroll runs"`, `"Export report"`) are treated as **buttons → sentence case**, not as static navigation menu items. Prism's "menu items use title case" rule applies to **navigational** menus (side nav, breadcrumbs, top-level nav links pointing to pages), not action menus.
- **Buttons that reference a named page** (e.g. `"Go to Setup Wizard"`, `"Back to Payroll Hub"`, `"Open Time Review"`) **preserve the page name's title case** while the surrounding button copy stays sentence case. The page name is a proper noun in this context.

### Numbers and Dates

- Use numerals, not words ("12" not "twelve") — saves space and scans faster.
- Spell out the month in dates: "August 5, 2025" or "5 August 2025" — never "8/5/2025" or "8.5.2025" (ambiguous across locales).
- Spell out day of the week and month; abbreviate only when space is constrained (e.g., tables, mobile): "Sat., Jan. 24".
- **Avoid ordinal suffixes** in dates: write "August 5", not "August 5th"; write "May 1", not "May 1st".
- **Year ranges** use a hyphen with the full year on both sides: "2015-2016", not "2015-16" and not "2015 to 2016".

### Tense

- Prefer past tense over present perfect for status messages: "File uploaded" not "File has been uploaded"
- Present perfect adds words without adding meaning in most UI contexts

### Abbreviations

- Only use abbreviations your users will immediately understand (common: PDF, URL, ID)
- Spell out on first use if there's any doubt, then abbreviate after: "application programming interface (API)"
- Latin abbreviations (e.g., i.e., etc.) — use proper punctuation: period after each letter, comma before and after in a sentence
- When in doubt, spell it out

## Voice and Tone

### Voice (Consistent Brand Personality)
Voice is the consistent personality of the product. Establish voice using:
- **Concepts**: 3-5 key brand principles/values
- **Voice characteristics**: Descriptive adjectives for each concept
- **Do/Don't examples**: Concrete examples showing voice in action

See references/voice-chart-template.md for creating a voice chart.

### Tone (Adaptive to Context)
Tone is how voice adapts to specific situations. While voice remains constant, tone shifts based on user context and emotional state.

**Tone Variables**
- **Purpose**: Why user is seeing this text (information, action, confirmation)
- **Context**: What user is trying to do (learning, completing task, recovering from error)
- **Emotional state**: How user likely feels (frustrated, excited, confused, cautious)
- **Stakes**: Impact of the action (low: changing theme, high: deleting account)

**Tone Adaptation by User Emotional State**

**Frustrated** (errors, failures, blockers)
- Empathetic and solution-focused
- Acknowledge the problem without blame
- Provide clear recovery path
- Example: "Payment failed. Your card was declined. Try a different payment method."

**Confused** (first use, complex features)
- Patient and explanatory
- Break down steps clearly
- Provide context and guidance
- Example: "Connect your bank to see spending insights. We'll guide you through it."

**Confident** (routine tasks, return visits)
- Efficient and direct
- Minimal explanation
- Quick confirmation
- Example: "Saved"

**Cautious** (high-stakes actions, data loss)
- Serious and transparent
- Clear consequences
- Respectful of user's decision
- Example: "Delete account? You'll lose all data and this can't be undone."

**Successful** (completions, achievements)
- Positive and encouraging
- Proportional to achievement
- Brief celebration
- Example: "Profile updated. Your changes are live."

**Tone Adaptation by Content Type**

**Error messages**: Empathetic, reassuring, solution-focused
- Never blame user
- Explain what happened
- Provide clear next step

**Success messages**: Positive, specific, encouraging
- Confirm what happened
- Proportional to action importance
- Brief and clear

**Instructions**: Clear, direct, helpful
- Front-load key action
- Explain why when needed
- Use simple steps

**Onboarding**: Inviting, encouraging, concise
- Welcome without overwhelming
- Focus on value
- Celebrate early wins

**Confirmations**: Serious, transparent, respectful
- Clear about consequences
- No manipulation
- Easy to back out

**Empty states**: Hopeful, actionable, guiding
- Explain why it's empty
- Provide clear next action
- Keep encouraging tone

## Editing Process

Edit UX text in four phases:

### Phase 1: Purposeful
- Does text help user achieve their goal?
- Does text serve business objectives?
- Is value to user clear?
- Are concerns anticipated and addressed?

### Phase 2: Concise
- Remove unnecessary words
- Combine redundant information
- Ensure every word earns its space
- Front-load important concepts

### Phase 3: Conversational
- Read aloud—would you say this?
- Use active voice (unless passive is clearer)
- Include natural connecting words
- Avoid corporate jargon

### Phase 4: Clear
- Use specific, accurate verbs
- Maintain consistent terminology
- Test readability (Hemingway Editor, Flesch-Kincaid)
- Ensure unambiguous meaning

## Workflow

1. **Understand context**
   - User goals and needs
   - Business objectives
   - Technical constraints
   - Emotional state of user

2. **Draft content**
   - Start with conversation (what would you say?)
   - Apply appropriate pattern
   - Consider voice and tone
   - Front-load important information

3. **Edit iteratively**
   - Phase 1: Purposeful
   - Phase 2: Concise
   - Phase 3: Conversational
   - Phase 4: Clear

4. **Test and measure**
   - Review with team
   - Test with users when possible
   - Measure task completion, comprehension
   - Iterate based on feedback

## Accessibility in UX Writing

Writing accessible content ensures all users, including those using assistive technology, can understand and interact with your product.

### Core Accessibility Principles

**Screen Reader Optimization**
- Label all interactive elements explicitly ("Submit form" not just "Submit")
- Write descriptive link text ("Read pricing details" not "Click here")
- Structure error messages to work with screen readers (error + field label read together)
- Use ARIA labels when visual context isn't sufficient

**Cognitive Accessibility**
- Target 8-14 words per sentence (8 words = 100% comprehension, 14 words = 90%)
- Break complex information into scannable chunks
- Use clear headings and logical hierarchy
- Provide consistent, predictable patterns

**Multi-Modal Communication**
- Don't rely on color alone to convey meaning
- Pair visual indicators with text ("Error: Email required" with red icon)
- Provide text alternatives for icons and images
- Ensure sufficient color contrast (WCAG AA minimum: 4.5:1)

**Plain Language for All**
- Target 7th-8th grade reading level for general audience
- Define technical terms when first used
- Avoid idioms, metaphors, and cultural references
- Use common, everyday words

### Accessible Pattern Examples

**Buttons**
- ❌ Poor: "Submit" (context missing for screen readers)
- ✅ Good: "Submit application"

**Links**
- ❌ Poor: "Click here for more information"
- ✅ Good: "Read our privacy policy"

**Error Messages**
- ❌ Poor: Red text showing "Invalid"
- ✅ Good: "Error: Email must include @" (with error icon)

**Form Labels**
- ❌ Poor: Placeholder-only fields
- ✅ Good: Visible label + optional placeholder

## UX Text Benchmarks

Use these research-backed metrics to create effective UX text.

### Sentence Length Targets

**By Content Type**
- **Buttons/CTAs**: 2-4 words ideal, 6 word maximum
- **Titles**: 3-6 words, 40 characters maximum
- **Error messages**: 12-18 words (including solution)
- **Instructions**: 20 words maximum, 14 ideal
- **Body copy**: 15-20 words per sentence average
- **Notifications**: 10-15 words for title + body

**Comprehension Rates**
- 8 words or fewer: 100% user comprehension
- 14 words or fewer: 90% user comprehension
- 25 words: Maximum before significant comprehension drop

### Character and Line Length

**Optimal Ranges**
- **Line length**: 40-60 characters for maximum readability
- **Button labels**: 15-25 characters
- **Page titles**: 30-50 characters
- **Notification titles**: 35-45 characters

### Reading Level Guidelines

**By Audience**
- **General public**: 7th-8th grade (Flesch-Kincaid)
- **Professional tools**: 9th-10th grade
- **Technical products**: 10th-11th grade
- **Specialized fields**: 11th-12th grade (only when necessary)

**Testing Tools**
- Hemingway Editor: Highlights complex sentences
- Readable.com: Provides multiple readability scores
- Microsoft Word: Built-in Flesch-Kincaid scoring

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Using passive voice excessively
- Generic button labels ("Submit", "OK")
- Blaming users in error messages
- Overly clever humor in serious contexts
- Inconsistent terminology
- Hidden instructions or explanations
- System-oriented language vs. user language
- Too many words (not concise enough)
- Robotic, corporate tone
- Relying on color alone for meaning
- Writing inaccessible link text ("Click here")

## Quick Reference

**Sentence case**: "Save your changes" (not "Save Your Changes")  
**Active imperative for buttons**: "Delete account" (not "Account deletion")  
**User-focused**: "Save time with shortcuts" (not "We offer shortcuts")  
**Specific verbs**: "Delete" (not "Remove" when permanently deleting)  
**Front-loaded**: "Password must be 8 characters" (not "Must be 8 characters for your password")

## Style references

External references this skill is grounded in (consult these for any case the skill doesn't cover):

- **Modus Style Guide** — Trimble's design-system writing rules (the canonical source for Modus-branded products).
- **The Chicago Manual of Style** — fallback for grammar, punctuation, and citation questions.
- **The Merriam-Webster Dictionary** — fallback for spelling and word choice.

Lista Payroll inherits Prism's writing conventions, which are themselves aligned with Modus. When this skill conflicts with `lista-ui-conventions` (e.g. "Coming soon" copy), the Lista rule wins.
